# electron-template
An even quicker-start for Electron. Electron template adds a `build.js` script, a customized .gitignore, and an Icon file which you can replace.

Build defaults to OSX x86, and will build against the latest version of Electron (pulling a more modern version from the web if needed).
Edit `build.js` to change build options, see [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) for more build options.

* Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/sleepygarden/electron-template.git`
* Install it: `npm install`
* Run it: `npm start`
* Build for Production: `npm run build`
